# Monster Tech Test

## Installation

```sh
yarn

And then:

```sh
yarn watch

This will run the app at [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234).

## Considerations

1. I decided to use `styled-components` (with a theme file) for easy styling of reusable components, and also a consistent, scalable design language.
2. I decided to use Parcel as the module bundler, as I prefer its simplicity and lack of boilerplate over Create React App and Webpack. For a larger production-scale project, I would choose to use Webpack instead.
